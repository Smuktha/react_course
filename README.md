# React Course – Learning Notes

This README contains my personal notes from the **React.js course** I am following.  
It’s for **my own reference**, helping me quickly recall commands, concepts, and setup steps.

---

## 📖 Basics
- **React.js** → A JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces (UI).
- **ReactDOM** → Handles rendering React elements into the DOM.
  - Example: If we create a variable in React, we use `ReactDOM.createRoot()` to show it on the frontend.

**Example:**
```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const h1 = React.createElement('h1', null, "Hello from Muktha");

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(h1);
````

## ⚙ Environment Setup

Check Node.js version:

```bash
node -v
```

Create a new React project using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite
```

**Steps during setup:**

1. Project name → `reactyt`
2. Framework → `React`
3. Variant → `JavaScript`

Navigate & install dependencies:

```bash
cd reactyt
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📝 JSX

* JSX = **JavaScript XML** (combines JavaScript and HTML syntax).
* Makes UI building easier and more readable.

**Example:**

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Hello Muktha! 🚀</h1>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 🛠 Useful Extensions

**Simple React Snippets** – Burke Holland (over 5M downloads)
Shortcut example:

* `rafce` → Creates a React Arrow Function Component with export.

**Generated by `rafce`:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
